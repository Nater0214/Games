# Welcome to Games!
These are the games. If you dont know the story behind this, then dont bother with this. This is a thing for my school.

## How to play
When you find a game you would like to play, click on the green code button, then click download zip.  
To play it just run the python file.
To ask for a new game, fill out [this](https://forms.gle/9MbKGM7LdwFmxyEd6).

## If you get caught?
If you get asked how you found these games or who made them, it wasnt me.  
In the case that this gets found out, I will have a backup plan ready.  
In that case, both this repository and the form will go private.

## Here are all the games:
- hmm, nothing is here yet. Ask for some games so I can get started.
