# Welcome to Games!
These are the games. If you dont know the story behind this, then dont bother with this. This is a thing for my school.

## How to play
Click on code, then click download zip. Extract the folder somewhere.  
Try hiding the folder by using an unassuming name.  
Now you can play all of the games by running any of the scripts.  
If you find any problems, then please tell me.    
To ask for a new game, fill out [this](https://forms.gle/9MbKGM7LdwFmxyEd6).

## If you get caught?
If you get asked how you found these games or who made them, it wasnt me.  
In the case that this gets found out, I will have a backup plan ready.  
In that case, both this repository and the form will go private.
